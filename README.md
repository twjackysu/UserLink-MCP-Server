# UserLink-MCP-Server
UserLink MCP Server is an open-source Microservices Hub for universal personal work data aggregation. It connects major SaaS platforms (Jira, Teams, Outlook, etc.) via OAuth. Designed as a pure data proxy, it offloads user auth to the API Gateway and only validates tokens for secure, unified data access.
